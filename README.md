# Device Price Classification System

## Overview

The Device Price Classification System is a machine learning application that predicts the price range of mobile devices based on their features. 
The model is built using a Random Forest Classifier, and it performs classification on devices' specifications to determine their price range.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**: Handles missing values and performs feature engineering on the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Random Forest Classifier using the training data.
- **Prediction**: Predicts the price range for devices in the test dataset.
- **Results**: Outputs predictions .

## Prerequisites

- **Python** (version 3.6 or higher)
- **Required Libraries**: pandas, scikit-learn

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JudyDukmak/devices-price-classification-system.git
   cd devices-price-classification-system
